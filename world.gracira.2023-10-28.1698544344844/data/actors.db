the magic of necromancy is utilized upon the preserved flesh of a humanoid, a zombie will rise to serve its dark master.Â  In much the same way that an animated skeleton is returned from the dead so too are zombies shunted back into this world.Â  While a skilled spellcaster may animate the dead and command the newly awakened, zombies may also rise in areas of the world saturated with necromantic energy.Â  In this situation, the zombies will not obey the command of a master, but roam aimlessly in a small area until they either find something to attack and consume or rot away into a pile of inanimate bones.Â Â </p>\n<p><strong>Re: Your Brains.</strong> Zombies do retain quite a lot of their former selves in regards to their physical appearance.Â  Zombies will still show the wounds or disease scars which slew them upon reanimating.Â  The symptoms of decay will also be present as many freshly spawned zombies will be bloated, have patches of skin sloughing from their bodies, or even trailing entrails from exploded abdomens.Â  While a zombie may resemble the person they were before, there is nothing at work within the head except mindless hunger.Â  Zombies stumble through their existence in a perpetual state of mindlessness only able to heed their masterâs orders.Â  This fact of the zombieâs mind makes them invaluable warriors for a necromancer in need.Â  Zombies are direct and will shamble off towards their quarry without so much as a second thought to their own safety.Â  Itâs been noted that some zombies have walked through fires or pits of acid in order to reach their enemies.Â  Once they reach their target, zombies will pummel and bite at their enemy until either they or the enemy fall in the tussle.Â  Zombies may also wield weapons, though not cleverly; zombies will not be able to reclaim a weapon should they be disarmed as the lack of weapon will simply drive them to claw with their broken hands.Â  The magic which binds the zombie to the mortal plane is tricky to the uninitiated as well, so please be warned young adventurers!Â  Should you fell a zombie, be aware that the creature may not be fully dead for the second time; you should always be sure to wait and see if the beast attempts to rise once more before wandering deeper into the dungeon.</p>\n<ul

and highly aggressive, the avian Axe Beak has maintained a well-earned reputation as an animal not to be toyed with.Â  Hailing from grassy plains to thick and sweltering jungles, the Axe Beak resembles the flightless emu in both size and appearance.Â  The Axe Beak sports a rounded, plump body resting upon two powerful legs built for running and kicking at high speeds.Â  From the body sprouts a long and graceful neck ending in an unfeathered head tipped with a sharp, wedge-shaped beak.Â  This beak (reminiscent of a hatchet) is what gives the creature its fearsome name.</p>\n<p><strong>Let Me Axe You a Question.</strong> Axe Beaks have been studied for quite some time, as their flightless footsteps have been tracked for thousands of years by biologists.Â  An ancient and relatively unchanged species, the Axe Beak is most notable (aside from the beak) for its temper.Â  Axe Beaks are incredibly territorial animals and have been known to chase down intruders within their territory for miles before finally calling off the attack.Â  Shockingly, some Axe Beaks have been domesticated through rigorous, consistent interaction with humanoids.Â  These beasts may act as riding animals and are powerful enough to support a fully grown Orc warrior.Â  During battle, should one be unfortunate enough to cross the bird, the Axe Beak will swing its powerful neck in a chopping arc to bring its sharpened beak down upon any unfortunate foe.Â  Should their beak (which has been known to sever limbs and pierce plate armor) not be enough, the Axe Beak may turn and deliver a devastating kick with one of its powerful, clawed feet.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#111111;font-size:13px\"><em

adventurer, were I able to precisely list every nature of cultists here for you, this tome would certainly span multitudinous volumes. Cultists, as their name describes, are those members of a secret underground society (or cult) whom very often practice a dark and unholy religion with their fellows. Beware adventurer! Not every cult is simply based around religious pretexts, there are those who seek political movements, those who are power hungry, and those who deign to meddle with forces our histories have lost long ago. Let me describe for you the very basics of common cult activity.</p>\n<p><strong>Friends on the Other Side.</strong> Cultists operate entirely in secrecy outside of the normal comings and goings of everyday life. What makes the cultist so fascinating is that they often attempt to blend seamlessly in with common folk: the barkeep at your favorite tavern, the guard near the gate, or even the dancer upon the stage may all be part of an underground community based ostensibly in evil. Now, to be clear, I do not encourage paranoia as cult activity is relatively rare in comparison to other, more immediate threats to our world; however, should a clever adventurer keep a keen eye out for secretive motions or gestures, odd symbols or markings, and even whispered code words, they can be certain they have stumbled into the workings of a cult. Quite commonly cultists align themselves with an ancient power trapped or dormant somewhere upon one of the more foul planes of existence. Their goals with this dark, godly force are myriad but often include control of a political structure, the deaths of hundreds if not thousands, or simply to sew despair and chaos across the realms of mortals. Unlike the desperate and cowardly bandits pushed to the brink by circumstance, cultists are often irredeemable foes. These men and women have been programed, brain-washed, or even directly controlled by their benefactor into the ways of darkness; often they are unfortunately unable to return to society once they have ingratiated themselves too deeply within the cult's network. Cults should always be handled and broken up with the utmost care; though the humanoid pawns behind the cult can be more easily dealt with, it should be remembered that cosmically evil forces may be

through the undergrowth of the jungle floor, a long silhouette glides soundlessly over the leaf litter stalking something yet unseen.Â  The beast is thick about its tubular body, the entire length rimmed with bands of muscle strong enough to suffocate a fully grown deer.Â  With a stout, club-shaped head and probing tongue, the constrictor snake shimmies ever-so stealthily towards its quarry.Â  Setting its dulled vision upon the rodent, the snake tastes the air with its forked tongue and pinpoints the ratâs position.Â  The hunt is over in a flash: striking like an arrow loosed from a bow, the snake sinks its needle-like fangs into the ratâs body before winding coil after coil of its body tightly around the rodentâs chest so it can crush and squeeze the last breath from the tiny beastâs body.Â  In a single, ugly gulp, the rat disappears into the snake.Â  Constrictor snakes inhabit, primarily, the jungles of the world and utilize their clever camouflage flecked scales to blend into the surrounding foliage.Â  Unlike their more venomous cousins, these snakes do not bear the hollow fangs to deliver a deadly dose of neurotoxin; rather, these snakes rely on their brute strength to strangle the life out of their victims.Â  While most constrictors are no threat to the average humanoid, there are some species large enough to consume a fully grown pony.Â  Beware the waters and thick brush of the jungle floor as this is where these deadly beasts prefer to hide.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope

little runtsâ¦ they ambushed us on the trail before weâd even been made aware weâd entered their âkingâsâ territory.Â  They attacked from out of the bushes like a tidal wave of bodies crashing into our cart, all the while gibbering in their foul, snarl of a tongue.Â  We should have been prepared for them, I recall their weaponry was so poor one bugger was swinging half a broom handle with a small iron spike driven through; nonetheless, they overwhelmed us with their surprise attack and made off with a hefty share of the campâs rations for the next month.<br /><em>Captain Will Freidmont of the Upper Wilds Valdyrguard.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Goblins are evil creatures of diminutive stature who exist in almost every corner of the natural world as a constant yet generally manageable threat.Â  Hailing from a group of creatures called goblinoids (which includes bugbears and hobgoblins), the goblin is a foul humanoid measuring no larger than the average halfling.Â  Goblins have skin tones varying from light clay to deep chestnut brown to a sickly, acidic green, their hair is thin and greasy, and within their jaws rest cracked and sharpened teeth.Â  Together with their foaming fellows, goblins form loose collectives or tribes so their power can stand pronounced in numbers.Â  The tribal life also allows for a crude caste system to erupt from the goblinâs chaotic politics.Â  All goblins have something to offer to the tribe, be they foragers, slavers, or warriors.Â  If they cannot contribute, they die.</p>\n<p><strong>We Live in a Society.Â </strong> Capricious to the last, goblins crave nothing more than power and domination of all others around them by any means (including those methods dangerous to the goblin).Â  Those goblins who possess enough might or cleverness may ascend to the rank of Goblin Boss and command a lair consisting of several dozens goblinoid fellows.Â  Should ambition prove overwhelming, the boss in rare cases may subjugate nearby lairs of rival goblinoids and crown themselves a Goblin Queen/King.Â  It has been documented that in one particular case, Queen Greld the Gutripper was able to enslave a camp containing hundreds of orcs, then laid siege to the city of Westerholt close by and sacked the entire city.</p>\n<p><strong>Gnash and Bite, Trick and Trap.</strong> Goblins maintain some of the most chaotic lairs within the known world, and to accomplish this the goblins require a plethora of slaves.Â  Not always willing to murder those they plunder, goblins and their kin are known slavers, spiriting away captured humans from merchant wagons to contruct their insidious dungeons.Â  WIthin a goblin lair is all manner of trap: tunnels leading nowhere, narrow passages no human could pass through, arrow slits, pits lined with spikes, and of course a multitude of alarms to warn the tribe of any impending danger.Â  Goblins utilize chaotic placement within their lairs to throw off intruders from their hard earned loot which is kept safe within the lairâs heart.</p>\n<p><strong>And They Dance About the Flames.</strong> Goblins, though commonly thought of as greedy and stupid, leave their chaotic tendancies behind when it comes to the structure of religious worship.Â  They are beholden in particular to The God of the Goblins, also called They Who Lurk Beneath, who acts as chief of all other gods to the goblinoids.Â  This god encourages acts of violence, blind cruelty, enslaving others, as well as war amongst the enemies of the goblins.Â  Goblin tribes will join together in times of worship to dance, perform rituals with blood and bone, build massive bonfires, and sew chaos throughout the lair all in devotion to their evil benefactor.Â  Goblins, fueled by the spirit of the revelry, will then be exceedingly aggressive and volatile for the days after, raging through the surrounding area to sate the thirst of their cruel god.</p>\n<ul

I swear itâs true!<br /><em>- Unknown Disorderly Patron at the Brass Buck Tavern.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What more could be said about the humble crab than is not already common knowledge to those who live near or frequent the coasts of the continent. Crabs are uniquely robust little creatures often no larger than the palm of an adult humanâs hand, with eight segmented legs protruding from either side of its scallop-shaped carapace. This hardened chitin carapace is topped with two black eye stalks (not unlike those of a snail) through which the beast views our coastlines and oceans. It has been observed that some species of crab lack an armored shell and prefer to squat in the discarded shells of conchs. This gives the crab a rather clever and sturdy mobile home. Adorning the crabs ninth and tenth appendages near its tiny mouth are two massive claws, resembling those of a scorpion, with dull serrations marking the inner edge of each. The crab primarily utilizes these claws in its search for food, cracking open the shells of other tiny aquatic beasts or snipping off tiny pieces of undersea plant life to dine on.</p>\n<p>While perhaps not the most dangerous companion a summoner could wish for, the crabâs ability to breath both in the water and upon land makes the crustacean an ally brimming with utility. I advise caution, however, when first looking through your crab familiarâs eyes, as the sideways scuttling by which the crab moves has proven to cause vomiting in some weak stomached summoners.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"user-select:text;color:#111111;font-size:13px\"><em style=\"user-select:text\">Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li

agile Pseudoraptors make their home in the darkest places that they can find. They prosper in their Underdark territories. Though they are the approximate size and shape of the average domestic rooster, they are highly organized social hunters who live in packs of up to one-hundred individuals. Their small bodies are covered with tightly packed scales that serve as natural armor and thick, plated tails for balance as they run at high speeds. One Pseudoraptor on its own is hardly a threat to most other creatures, but a dozen Pseudoraptors tracking a wayward humanoid is another story entirely. They find the most hunting success in surrounding their prey, throwing themselves at it to knock it off its feet, and piling on while its prone on the ground. Their large eyes are well-equipped to detecting the smallest of movements in the dark but also make them vulnerable to bright light. When confronted with something that emits bright light, their strongest individuals will attack the light source ferociously in an attempt to make it go away.</p>\n<p><sub><em>Art source: <a href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/s4ffr0n/art/Rattle-Runner-667469415\">s4ffr0n on DeviantArtÂ </a>and modified under the <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\">CC BY-NC 4.0 License</a></em></sub></p>\n<p><em style=\"font-size:11.6667px\">Compendium entry by Parker (sparkcities#2000)</em></p>","public":""},"alignment":"Unaligned","race":"","type":{"value":"monstrosity","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"","cr":1,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":200},"source":""},"traits":{"size":"tiny","di":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":1,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":4,"prof":2,"total":6,"passive":16},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":1,"prof":0,"total":1,"passive":11},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":-3,"prof":0,"total":-3,"passive":7},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":0,"prof":0,"total":0,"passive":10},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":-3,"prof":0,"total":-3,"passive":7},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":-3,"prof":0,"total":-3,"passive":7},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":1,"prof":0,"total":1,"passive":11},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":-3,"prof":0,"total":-3,"passive":7},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":-3,"prof":0,"total":-3,"passive":7},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":1,"prof":0,"total":1,"passive":11},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":-3,"prof":0,"total":-3,"passive":7},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":1,"prof":0,"total":1,"passive":11},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":-3,"prof":0,"total":-3,"passive":7},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":-3,"prof":0,"total":-3,"passive":7},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":-3,"prof":0,"total":-3,"passive":7},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":4,"prof":0,"total":4,"passive":14},"ste":{"value":1,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":4,"prof":2,"total":6,"passive":16},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"bonus":0,"mod":1,"prof":0,"total":1,"passive":11}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"HImCC4pPhzVTwkfq":3,"m5B2WtLrdUfcHWLF":3},"prototypeToken":{"flags":{},"name":"Pseudoraptor","displayName":0,"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":1,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"texture":{"src":"modules/SupplementalBestiary/assets/pseudoraptor.png","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1671767237672,"lastModifiedBy":"m5B2WtLrdUfcHWLF"}}

Thinking myself a rather clever sleuth in finding some ill-witted banditâs secret treasures, I did quickly reach my hand within the tunnel only to be greeted by something oddly fuzzy and a most severe pain to boot! Let my incident (and missing finger) with the woodland badger be warning to those lacking in wisdom; do not reach into places where your hand does not belong!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>- Merchant Lord Ellemond Doughty.</p>\n<p>The common forest dwelling badger is a creature of ingenuity and sheer determination. This creature, resembling a most rotund and powerful weasel, busies itself upon the forest floor catching its prey of insects and small mammals all the while toiling away at creating itself a sett, or more commonly called, a burrow. The badgerâs coat is decked in marvelous black and white stripes running the length of its body. With gentle eyes and an otherwise calm demeanor, the badger exudes an image of a more timid beast; however, this outer appearance should be observed with caution. Armed with thick, elongated claws made for churning through the toughest of soil and a set of powerful jaws to match, badgers are quick to defend themselves should a foolish soul harass them. As long as you do not agitate the badger, it will find no recourse to harm you.</p>\n<p><strong>Miraculous Mandibles.</strong> A badgerâs most intriguing feature is a set of peculiar jawbones with provide it with a spectacular method of defense. The animalâs jaws are set into long cavities within its skull allowing the badger to lock its jaws in place thus increasing its already powerful bite strength and avoid the possibility of mandible dislocation. A truly remarkable evolutionary advantage in avoiding combat (rather than confronting its adversary) is the badgerâs natural odor. These creatures can release a powerful musk from scent glands located near their rears which can easily drive away predators. It is for these reasons that many forest dwelling cultures revere the badger as a guardian of the forest and attempt to utilize the badgerâs unique abilities in their own bid for survival in the wilds of our world.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"user-select:text;color:#111111;font-size:13px\"><em style=\"user-select:text\">Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li

Almost a carbon copy of the ground-dwelling common snakes, the flying snake has simply evolved wings by some uncanny biological need or magical meddling. These thin, membrane lined wings allow the snake to clumsily glide through the air, avoiding the clutter of the jungle floor with ease. Brightly colored with glittering veridian scales, these flying serpents are truly beautiful to behold as they glide, lithe and swooping, through the canopy of vines and dense foliage. The thin little windmasters have often found themselves in the service of jungle cultists or tribal magic wielders. With some coaxing and gentle attempts at domestication, the owner may be rewarded with a unique and uncannily loyal ally to curl about their forearm on any number of adventures. Some have even utilized these reptiles as messengers as they are small and may journey through the treetops in relative secrecy!</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"user-select:text;color:#111111;font-size:13px\"><em style=\"user-select:text\">Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li style=\"user-select:text;color:#111111;font-size:13px\"><em style=\"user-select:text\">Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Unaligned","race":null,"type":{"value":"beast","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"Grassland","cr":0.125,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":25},"source":"MM pg. 322","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"tiny","di":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"perception":{"_deprecated":true}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14,"prof":0,"total":4},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14,"prof":0,"total":4},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14,"prof":0,"total":4},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":"","rwak":"","msak":"","rsak":"","abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""},"damage":"","abilityCheck":"","abilitySave":"","skillCheck":""},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"iP1HQBArS7pzHRZT":3,"m5B2WtLrdUfcHWLF":3},"prototypeToken":{"flags":{},"name":"Flying Snake","displayName":20,"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":1,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"texture":{"src":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/FlyingSnake.webp","tint":null,"scaleX":0.8,"scaleY":0.8,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":10,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1671767237434,"lastModifiedBy":"m5B2WtLrdUfcHWLF"}}

Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.</p>\n<h2>Way of the Open Hand</h2>\n<p>Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed.

Amazed by even the most rudimentary of modern technologies, such as metal, swallybogs will quickly deify creatures that bring even a modicum of comfort or order to their lives. Their culture follows a loose hierarchy based on morphological adaptations encountered along their tumultuous lifecycle.</p>\n<p>Early Life. Within holy swabologsâbirthponds, in commonâswallybogs begin their life as limbless tadpoles, void of sex or gender. When food is scarce, these tadpoles can become cannibalistic, ensuring only the strongest (or most devious) survive. Some more barbaric tribes purposefully limit food input to bring about this struggleâknown as a florbrackaâensuring the strength of the next generation.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Emergence &amp; Growth. </strong></em>After a year, these tadpoles absorb their tails and sprout limbs, clambering through the vines and mud to breathe air for the first time, an event known as the Guppening. If a swallybog reaches adulthood, an uncommon occurrence in the alligator-filled waterways of swamps, it undergoes a moulting. From its old skin, the swallybog emerges as a sharpfin.Â </p>\n<p>These muscular swallybogs have fins to increase their underwater movement, and adopt the smaller, forward-facing eyes of a predator. These individuals are the guards and hunters of the swallybog people, and are the most likely to encounter wandering adventurers.

little runtsâ¦ they ambushed us on the trail before weâd even been made aware weâd entered their âkingâsâ territory.Â  They attacked from out of the bushes like a tidal wave of bodies crashing into our cart, all the while gibbering in their foul, snarl of a tongue.Â  We should have been prepared for them, I recall their weaponry was so poor one bugger was swinging half a broom handle with a small iron spike driven through; nonetheless, they overwhelmed us with their surprise attack and made off with a hefty share of the campâs rations for the next month.<br /><em>Captain Will Freidmont of the Upper Wilds Valdyrguard.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Goblins are evil creatures of diminutive stature who exist in almost every corner of the natural world as a constant yet generally manageable threat.Â  Hailing from a group of creatures called goblinoids (which includes bugbears and hobgoblins), the goblin is a foul humanoid measuring no larger than the average halfling.Â  Goblins have skin tones varying from light clay to deep chestnut brown to a sickly, acidic green, their hair is thin and greasy, and within their jaws rest cracked and sharpened teeth.Â  Together with their foaming fellows, goblins form loose collectives or tribes so their power can stand pronounced in numbers.Â  The tribal life also allows for a crude caste system to erupt from the goblinâs chaotic politics.Â  All goblins have something to offer to the tribe, be they foragers, slavers, or warriors.Â  If they cannot contribute, they die.</p>\n<p><strong>We Live in a Society.Â </strong> Capricious to the last, goblins crave nothing more than power and domination of all others around them by any means (including those methods dangerous to the goblin).Â  Those goblins who possess enough might or cleverness may ascend to the rank of Goblin Boss and command a lair consisting of several dozens goblinoid fellows.Â  Should ambition prove overwhelming, the boss in rare cases may subjugate nearby lairs of rival goblinoids and crown themselves a Goblin Queen/King.Â  It has been documented that in one particular case, Queen Greld the Gutripper was able to enslave a camp containing hundreds of orcs, then laid siege to the city of Westerholt close by and sacked the entire city.</p>\n<p><strong>Gnash and Bite, Trick and Trap.</strong> Goblins maintain some of the most chaotic lairs within the known world, and to accomplish this the goblins require a plethora of slaves.Â  Not always willing to murder those they plunder, goblins and their kin are known slavers, spiriting away captured humans from merchant wagons to contruct their insidious dungeons.Â  WIthin a goblin lair is all manner of trap: tunnels leading nowhere, narrow passages no human could pass through, arrow slits, pits lined with spikes, and of course a multitude of alarms to warn the tribe of any impending danger.Â  Goblins utilize chaotic placement within their lairs to throw off intruders from their hard earned loot which is kept safe within the lairâs heart.</p>\n<p><strong>And They Dance About the Flames.</strong> Goblins, though commonly thought of as greedy and stupid, leave their chaotic tendancies behind when it comes to the structure of religious worship.Â  They are beholden in particular to The God of the Goblins, also called They Who Lurk Beneath, who acts as chief of all other gods to the goblinoids.Â  This god encourages acts of violence, blind cruelty, enslaving others, as well as war amongst the enemies of the goblins.Â  Goblin tribes will join together in times of worship to dance, perform rituals with blood and bone, build massive bonfires, and sew chaos throughout the lair all in devotion to their evil benefactor.Â  Goblins, fueled by the spirit of the revelry, will then be exceedingly aggressive and volatile for the days after, raging through the surrounding area to sate the thirst of their cruel god.</p>\n<ul

Thymtusk revels in the rage of others. Creatures are vulnerable when uncontrollably angry and it knows how to use this information against them. It stalks prey from a distance. When it's confident in knowing more about its prey, it becomes invisible and roams among them with its rage-inducing aura. More often than not, creatures turn against each other violently as it stokes their fury. The Thymtusk watches as even close friends and family turn on each other. Then, once wounds have been inflicted and discord has been sewn, it launches in to finish off the job and to claim an easy meal.</p>\n<p><sub><em>Art source: <a

I swear it's true!!!\"</p>\n<p>- Unknown Disorderly Patron at the Brass Buck Tavern.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>What more could be said about the humble crab than is not already common knowledge to those who live near or frequent the coasts of the continent. Crabs are uniquely robust little creatures often no larger than the palm of an adult human's hand, with eight segmented legs protruding from either side of its scallop-shaped carapace. This hardened chitin carapace is topped with two black eye stalks (not unlike those of a snail) through which the beast views our coastlines and oceans. It has been observed that some species of crab lack an armored shell and prefer to squat in the discarded shells of conchs. This gives the crab a rather clever and sturdy mobile home. Adorning the crabs ninth and tenth appendages near its tiny mouth are two massive claws, resembling those of a scorpion, with dull serrations marking the inner edge of each. The crab primarily utilizes these claws in its search for food, cracking open the shells of other tiny aquatic beasts or snipping off tiny pieces of undersea plant life to dine on.</p>\n</section>\n<p>While perhaps not the most dangerous companion a summoner could wish for, the crab's ability to breath both in the water and upon land makes the crustacean an ally brimming with utility. I advise caution, however, when first looking through your crab familiar's eyes, as the sideways scuttling by which the crab moves has proven to cause vomiting in some weak stomached summoners.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"user-select:text;color:#111111;font-size:13px\"><em style=\"user-select:text\">Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li

little runtsâ¦ they ambushed us on the trail before weâd even been made aware weâd entered their âkingâsâ territory.Â  They attacked from out of the bushes like a tidal wave of bodies crashing into our cart, all the while gibbering in their foul, snarl of a tongue.Â  We should have been prepared for them, I recall their weaponry was so poor one bugger was swinging half a broom handle with a small iron spike driven through; nonetheless, they overwhelmed us with their surprise attack and made off with a hefty share of the campâs rations for the next month.<br /><em>Captain Will Freidmont of the Upper Wilds Valdyrguard.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Goblins are evil creatures of diminutive stature who exist in almost every corner of the natural world as a constant yet generally manageable threat.Â  Hailing from a group of creatures called goblinoids (which includes bugbears and hobgoblins), the goblin is a foul humanoid measuring no larger than the average halfling.Â  Goblins have skin tones varying from light clay to deep chestnut brown to a sickly, acidic green, their hair is thin and greasy, and within their jaws rest cracked and sharpened teeth.Â  Together with their foaming fellows, goblins form loose collectives or tribes so their power can stand pronounced in numbers.Â  The tribal life also allows for a crude caste system to erupt from the goblinâs chaotic politics.Â  All goblins have something to offer to the tribe, be they foragers, slavers, or warriors.Â  If they cannot contribute, they die.</p>\n<p><strong>We Live in a Society.Â </strong> Capricious to the last, goblins crave nothing more than power and domination of all others around them by any means (including those methods dangerous to the goblin).Â  Those goblins who possess enough might or cleverness may ascend to the rank of Goblin Boss and command a lair consisting of several dozens goblinoid fellows.Â  Should ambition prove overwhelming, the boss in rare cases may subjugate nearby lairs of rival goblinoids and crown themselves a Goblin Queen/King.Â  It has been documented that in one particular case, Queen Greld the Gutripper was able to enslave a camp containing hundreds of orcs, then laid siege to the city of Westerholt close by and sacked the entire city.</p>\n<p><strong>Gnash and Bite, Trick and Trap.</strong> Goblins maintain some of the most chaotic lairs within the known world, and to accomplish this the goblins require a plethora of slaves.Â  Not always willing to murder those they plunder, goblins and their kin are known slavers, spiriting away captured humans from merchant wagons to contruct their insidious dungeons.Â  WIthin a goblin lair is all manner of trap: tunnels leading nowhere, narrow passages no human could pass through, arrow slits, pits lined with spikes, and of course a multitude of alarms to warn the tribe of any impending danger.Â  Goblins utilize chaotic placement within their lairs to throw off intruders from their hard earned loot which is kept safe within the lairâs heart.</p>\n<p><strong>And They Dance About the Flames.</strong> Goblins, though commonly thought of as greedy and stupid, leave their chaotic tendancies behind when it comes to the structure of religious worship.Â  They are beholden in particular to The God of the Goblins, also called They Who Lurk Beneath, who acts as chief of all other gods to the goblinoids.Â  This god encourages acts of violence, blind cruelty, enslaving others, as well as war amongst the enemies of the goblins.Â  Goblin tribes will join together in times of worship to dance, perform rituals with blood and bone, build massive bonfires, and sew chaos throughout the lair all in devotion to their evil benefactor.Â  Goblins, fueled by the spirit of the revelry, will then be exceedingly aggressive and volatile for the days after, raging through the surrounding area to sate the thirst of their cruel god.</p>\n<ul

your very own Blink Dog comes with a set of challenges all its own.Â  Often it is simply better to let the beast care for its own hygiene (circumstances allowing) as your precious pooch will likely blink off to the nearest mud puddle as soon as youâve finished cleaning them. <br /><em>Caring for your Blink Dog, pg. 46.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Blink Dogs are a notable curiosity amongst the common canine species.Â  On the outside, the hound appears to be quite similar to many a hunting mutt: a tannish, yellow complexion of the fur, average in size (standing anywhere from two and a half to three feet in height) and no markings or traits rendering it particularly unique.Â  However, the secret of this dog lies within.Â  The Blink Dog possesses an uncanny ability to âblinkâ or teleport at will from location to location in a flash.Â  In a similar vein to the spells utilized by mages to transport themselves across distances in a flash, the Blink Dog tears through the fabric of our reality, vanishes instantaneously and appears up to forty feet away from its original location.Â  The Blink Dog is unable to carry living things along with it, however any equipment or objects the hound currently holds will be transported.Â  Blink Dogs have an above average intelligence in comparison to other canines and are able to speak their own language, called âBlink Dogâ, to others of their kind.Â  What these discussions entail is a mystery, though it is speculated that often the packs of dogs will discuss their intense hatred for other ethereal quadrupeds as they are known to attack the beasts on sight.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#111111;font-size:13px\"><em style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\">Token artwork by

Here we will view the commonalities of what would be considered the âbanditâ class of criminal. Be advised while reviewing this information that not all bandits should be viewed with a scornful eye. While many seek harm or riches from their quarry, others thieve to survive in a world most unfair.</p>\n<p><strong>The Good.</strong> We begin with those bandits who could be seen as ânoble criminalsâ. These bandits consist of the most downtrodden of our nations, those citizens who have struggled through poverty and oppression to scrape out a meager existence clinging to any comfort they can grasp. Consider what would drive a person to commit something so desperate as robbery or open theft in a village street. Bandits of a nobler sort may still be selfish with their earnings, taking what they have stolen to enrich their own lives or those of immediate relations. There are some bandits, however, who seek to use their pilfered goods to improve the lives of the poorer community. Be aware that often these bandits are desperate and afraid, especially during the act of robbery. They are scared, driven to crime by poor circumstances, so they may not require violence to disperse as more often than not they will not physically harm their victims. Keep an open mind as you travel through the world young adventurer and remember that were the tables turned, you may wish for mercy for such a minor infraction.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bad and Ugly.</strong> For every good-hearted soul stealing from those with too much and giving to the unfortunate, there is a truly villainous spirit lurking behind the brush of a nearby road, lying in wait for an unsuspecting victim. During your travels, adventurer, these sorts may be the most common instances of banditry you will experience. Armed with swords, clubs, and bows, the more nefarious of the bandit world prefer to ambush their prey from the shadows of hills and trees, catching traveling parties unaware. These treacherous thieves will attempt diversion and trickery in order to catch their quarry off guard should their crew be outnumbered. Bandits have no boundaries of borders or locale, so caution should be taken whether you walk upon a forested road or sail the high seas as you island hop for fame. Danger lurks in every corner of our world adventurer, be prepared and discerning should you encounter a party of brigands lest your career end well before your legend is written.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":" Chaotic Good Evil","race":null,"type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":null,"cr":0.125,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":25},"source":"MM pg. 343","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common"],"custom":""},"perception":{"_deprecated":true}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":"","rwak":"","msak":"","rsak":"","abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""},"damage":"","abilityCheck":"","abilitySave":"","skillCheck":""},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"m5B2WtLrdUfcHWLF":3},"prototypeToken":{"flags":{},"name":"Bandit","displayName":20,"width":1,"height":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":1,"angle":360,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"type":null,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"attenuation":0.5,"color":null},"texture":{"src":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/Bandit.webp","tint":null,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0},"sight":{"angle":360,"enabled":false,"range":0,"brightness":1,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[]},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1671767237231,"lastModifiedBy":"m5B2WtLrdUfcHWLF"}}

Colleges</h1>\n<h2>College of Lore</h2>\n<p>Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.</p>\n<p>The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.</p>\n<p>The collegeâs members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.</p>\n<h3>College of Lore Features</h3>\n<p>3rd

Colleges</h1>\n<h2>College of Lore</h2>\n<p>Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.</p>\n<p>The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.</p>\n<p>The collegeâs members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.</p>\n<h3>College of Lore Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.e9ytGikyLFgwZ5wi]{Bonus Proficiencies} @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.5zPmHPQUne7RDfaU]{Cutting Words}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.myBu3zi5eYvQIcuy]{Additional Magical Secrets}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.pquwueEMweRhiWaq]{Peerless Skill}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"","levels":1,"hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[],"saves":[],"skills":{"number":3,"choices":["acr","ani","arc","ath","dec","his","ins","itm","inv","med","nat","prc","per","prf","rel","slt","ste","sur"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":""},"subclass":"","damage":{"parts":[]},"critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"_id":"MX29mr6A5oqePYyF","name":"Spellcasting (Bard)","type":"feat","sort":-100000,"flags":{"pick-up-stix":{"pick-up-stix":{"initialState":{"count":1,"itemData":{"_id":"MX29mr6A5oqePYyF","name":"Spellcasting (Bard)","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music.

the magic of necromancy is utilized upon the preserved flesh of a humanoid, a zombie will rise to serve its dark master.Â  In much the same way that an animated skeleton is returned from the dead so too are zombies shunted back into this world.Â  While a skilled spellcaster may animate the dead and command the newly awakened, zombies may also rise in areas of the world saturated with necromantic energy.Â  In this situation, the zombies will not obey the command of a master, but roam aimlessly in a small area until they either find something to attack and consume or rot away into a pile of inanimate bones.Â Â </p>\n<p><strong>Re: Your Brains.</strong> Zombies do retain quite a lot of their former selves in regards to their physical appearance.Â  Zombies will still show the wounds or disease scars which slew them upon reanimating.Â  The symptoms of decay will also be present as many freshly spawned zombies will be bloated, have patches of skin sloughing from their bodies, or even trailing entrails from exploded abdomens.Â  While a zombie may resemble the person they were before, there is nothing at work within the head except mindless hunger.Â  Zombies stumble through their existence in a perpetual state of mindlessness only able to heed their masterâs orders.Â  This fact of the zombieâs mind makes them invaluable warriors for a necromancer in need.Â  Zombies are direct and will shamble off towards their quarry without so much as a second thought to their own safety.Â  Itâs been noted that some zombies have walked through fires or pits of acid in order to reach their enemies.Â  Once they reach their target, zombies will pummel and bite at their enemy until either they or the enemy fall in the tussle.Â  Zombies may also wield weapons, though not cleverly; zombies will not be able to reclaim a weapon should they be disarmed as the lack of weapon will simply drive them to claw with their broken hands.Â  The magic which binds the zombie to the mortal plane is tricky to the uninitiated as well, so please be warned young adventurers!Â  Should you fell a zombie, be aware that the creature may not be fully dead for the second time; you should always be sure to wait and see if the beast attempts to rise once more before wandering deeper into the dungeon.</p>\n<ul

Stirges resemble nothing more than a slightly oversized bat crossed with a mosquito; however, upon closer inspection the Stirge reveals much more. Coated in greasy, pink flesh (save for a small tufted mane of white fur about its head and neck) the Stirge is equipped with a pair of small, bat-like wings made of stretched flesh between struts of thin bone. The skin here at the wing is so thin that light may easily shine through the beast's wings revealing the tiny vesicles within. Stirges also possess a set of six, spindly legs above their pig-like tail. Each leg is tipped with a set of hooked claws which allows the fiend to grip into the flesh of its prey and hang on should a struggle ensue. However, there is one more feature that makes the Stirge truly repugnant.</p>\n<p><strong>What's Your Type?</strong> Stirges are notable for their ravenous desire to consume the blood of living organisms. These beasts accomplish this foul act with aid from the needle-sharp proboscis waiting at the end of its oversized snout. Gifted with the ability of flight, the Stirge dives down upon an unsuspecting enemy and clamps onto their body with the aid of their barbed claws. The Stirge then drives its proboscis into their victim's flesh, sucking out ounce after ounce of warm blood. Only when the Stirge is sufficiently sated (or battered away) will it release its victim to flee into the darkness where it may digest its liquid lunch.

are the largest of the wild dog species roaming the plains and forests of our wonderful world.Â  Anywhere from light brown to a midnight black in coloration, wolves stand as the common ancestor to all natural dog species currently inhabiting the planet.Â  Wolves have a long, broad muzzle filled with sharp teeth, a thick coat to insulate them from difficult winters, and keen eyes and ears with which they may track a target.Â  The most amazing aspect of the wolf is its incredible nose which can smell prey from up to one and a half miles away.Â  This amazing nose (packed with hundreds of millions of scent receptors) can also determine the mood of other wolves, what theyâve eaten, and even where theyâve been..</p>\n<p><strong>The Wolves Among Us.</strong> As is common with many other dog species, wolves live in communities called packs.Â  WIthin the pack, wolves hunt together, raise their young together, and provide group protection.Â  When encountering wolves, be wary should you only spy a single animal prowling the area.Â  Itâs quite likely where there is a straggler wolf, the rest of the pack lurks nearby ready to defend their family from attack.Â  Wolves, which unable to speak, are able to âcommunicateâ via barks and growls as well as follow simplistic tactics such as flanking maneuvers or surprise attacks.Â  The strength of the pack allows for the wolves to combine their intelligence and form a deadly fighting force of gnashing teeth.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-size:13px\">\n<li

first time you see those hollow sockets staring back at you with some semblance of thought inside the skull, I advise to quash any feelings of accomplishment.Â  The skeletal servant you have raised is little more than a brainless husk.Â  Without proper, and I mean proper, instruction, the bones in front of you might as well have remained dusty upon the floor.Â  Explain the orders carefully and lay out the steps of your new servantâs tasks with exceeding care.Â  Also, should you catch your skeletal friend partaking in the activities of their former life, do not scold them.Â  The mundane routine of chopping wood or swinging a hammer can allow for more malleable servants as time continues.<br /><em>The Book of Dark Servants, Vol III.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Skeletons are beings raised into undeath by the will of necromantic magic.Â  The necromantic magics used within the ritual can either be cast by a trained hand or simply seep into the bones of the skeleton in areas of concentrated death.Â  Cemeteries, catacombs, and battle fields are all subject to the sporadic rising of skeletons into their new lives.Â  The magic not only keeps the skeleton âlivingâ, but it also binds joints and bones together like spectral ligaments.Â  With its second life, the skeleton acts as a semi-mindless creature serving its masterâs will.</p>\n<p><strong>Spooky Scary.</strong> For the up and coming necromancer, skeletons make worthy guards for a hidden repository of forbidden knowledge.Â  Skeletons will follow simple to mildly complex orders given (such as forming a protective circle or constructing minor defenses) without the necromancer needing to worry about the durability of their creations.Â  The skeletons will avoid danger and refuse to injure themselves unless explicitly ordered by their master.Â  Skeletons do seem to grow rather bored without direction and have been observed ambling around an area performing simple actions from their past lives.Â  One notable skeleton I recall was still able to cast their fishing line, though clumsily at best, into the nearby lake.Â  Skeletons, however, are not utilized for their prior skills but as guardians of the necromancer who summoned them back from the hells.Â  Skeletons are more than capable when swinging a sword or firing a crossbow, finding martial prowess in death that they may have lacked in life thanks to the dark power flowing through their marrow.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Authorâs Note: Not all skeletal adversaries in an adventurerâs journey will be humanoid.Â  Be wary, as significant magics can summon back more powerful skeletal monsters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;color:#191813;font-size:13px\">\n<li

little runtsâ¦ they ambushed us on the trail before weâd even been made aware weâd entered their âkingâsâ territory.Â  They attacked from out of the bushes like a tidal wave of bodies crashing into our cart, all the while gibbering in their foul, snarl of a tongue.Â  We should have been prepared for them, I recall their weaponry was so poor one bugger was swinging half a broom handle with a small iron spike driven through; nonetheless, they overwhelmed us with their surprise attack and made off with a hefty share of the campâs rations for the next month.<br /><em>Captain Will Freidmont of the Upper Wilds Valdyrguard.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Goblins are evil creatures of diminutive stature who exist in almost every corner of the natural world as a constant yet generally manageable threat.Â  Hailing from a group of creatures called goblinoids (which includes bugbears and hobgoblins), the goblin is a foul humanoid measuring no larger than the average halfling.Â  Goblins have skin tones varying from light clay to deep chestnut brown to a sickly, acidic green, their hair is thin and greasy, and within their jaws rest cracked and sharpened teeth.Â  Together with their foaming fellows, goblins form loose collectives or tribes so their power can stand pronounced in numbers.Â  The tribal life also allows for a crude caste system to erupt from the goblinâs chaotic politics.Â  All goblins have something to offer to the tribe, be they foragers, slavers, or warriors.Â  If they cannot contribute, they die.</p>\n<p><strong>We Live in a Society.Â </strong> Capricious to the last, goblins crave nothing more than power and domination of all others around them by any means (including those methods dangerous to the goblin).Â  Those goblins who possess enough might or cleverness may ascend to the rank of Goblin Boss and command a lair consisting of several dozens goblinoid fellows.Â  Should ambition prove overwhelming, the boss in rare cases may subjugate nearby lairs of rival goblinoids and crown themselves a Goblin Queen/King.Â  It has been documented that in one particular case, Queen Greld the Gutripper was able to enslave a camp containing hundreds of orcs, then laid siege to the city of Westerholt close by and sacked the entire city.</p>\n<p><strong>Gnash and Bite, Trick and Trap.</strong> Goblins maintain some of the most chaotic lairs within the known world, and to accomplish this the goblins require a plethora of slaves.Â  Not always willing to murder those they plunder, goblins and their kin are known slavers, spiriting away captured humans from merchant wagons to contruct their insidious dungeons.Â  WIthin a goblin lair is all manner of trap: tunnels leading nowhere, narrow passages no human could pass through, arrow slits, pits lined with spikes, and of course a multitude of alarms to warn the tribe of any impending danger.Â  Goblins utilize chaotic placement within their lairs to throw off intruders from their hard earned loot which is kept safe within the lairâs heart.</p>\n<p><strong>And They Dance About the Flames.</strong> Goblins, though commonly thought of as greedy and stupid, leave their chaotic tendancies behind when it comes to the structure of religious worship.Â  They are beholden in particular to The God of the Goblins, also called They Who Lurk Beneath, who acts as chief of all other gods to the goblinoids.Â  This god encourages acts of violence, blind cruelty, enslaving others, as well as war amongst the enemies of the goblins.Â  Goblin tribes will join together in times of worship to dance, perform rituals with blood and bone, build massive bonfires, and sew chaos throughout the lair all in devotion to their evil benefactor.Â  Goblins, fueled by the spirit of the revelry, will then be exceedingly aggressive and volatile for the days after, raging through the surrounding area to sate the thirst of their cruel god.</p>\n<ul

little runtsâ¦ they ambushed us on the trail before weâd even been made aware weâd entered their âkingâsâ territory.Â  They attacked from out of the bushes like a tidal wave of bodies crashing into our cart, all the while gibbering in their foul, snarl of a tongue.Â  We should have been prepared for them, I recall their weaponry was so poor one bugger was swinging half a broom handle with a small iron spike driven through; nonetheless, they overwhelmed us with their surprise attack and made off with a hefty share of the campâs rations for the next month.<br /><em>Captain Will Freidmont of the Upper Wilds Valdyrguard.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Goblins are evil creatures of diminutive stature who exist in almost every corner of the natural world as a constant yet generally manageable threat.Â  Hailing from a group of creatures called goblinoids (which includes bugbears and hobgoblins), the goblin is a foul humanoid measuring no larger than the average halfling.Â  Goblins have skin tones varying from light clay to deep chestnut brown to a sickly, acidic green, their hair is thin and greasy, and within their jaws rest cracked and sharpened teeth.Â  Together with their foaming fellows, goblins form loose collectives or tribes so their power can stand pronounced in numbers.Â  The tribal life also allows for a crude caste system to erupt from the goblinâs chaotic politics.Â  All goblins have something to offer to the tribe, be they foragers, slavers, or warriors.Â  If they cannot contribute, they die.</p>\n<p><strong>We Live in a Society.Â </strong> Capricious to the last, goblins crave nothing more than power and domination of all others around them by any means (including those methods dangerous to the goblin).Â  Those goblins who possess enough might or cleverness may ascend to the rank of Goblin Boss and command a lair consisting of several dozens goblinoid fellows.Â  Should ambition prove overwhelming, the boss in rare cases may subjugate nearby lairs of rival goblinoids and crown themselves a Goblin Queen/King.Â  It has been documented that in one particular case, Queen Greld the Gutripper was able to enslave a camp containing hundreds of orcs, then laid siege to the city of Westerholt close by and sacked the entire city.</p>\n<p><strong>Gnash and Bite, Trick and Trap.</strong> Goblins maintain some of the most chaotic lairs within the known world, and to accomplish this the goblins require a plethora of slaves.Â  Not always willing to murder those they plunder, goblins and their kin are known slavers, spiriting away captured humans from merchant wagons to contruct their insidious dungeons.Â  WIthin a goblin lair is all manner of trap: tunnels leading nowhere, narrow passages no human could pass through, arrow slits, pits lined with spikes, and of course a multitude of alarms to warn the tribe of any impending danger.Â  Goblins utilize chaotic placement within their lairs to throw off intruders from their hard earned loot which is kept safe within the lairâs heart.</p>\n<p><strong>And They Dance About the Flames.</strong> Goblins, though commonly thought of as greedy and stupid, leave their chaotic tendancies behind when it comes to the structure of religious worship.Â  They are beholden in particular to The God of the Goblins, also called They Who Lurk Beneath, who acts as chief of all other gods to the goblinoids.Â  This god encourages acts of violence, blind cruelty, enslaving others, as well as war amongst the enemies of the goblins.Â  Goblin tribes will join together in times of worship to dance, perform rituals with blood and bone, build massive bonfires, and sew chaos throughout the lair all in devotion to their evil benefactor.Â  Goblins, fueled by the spirit of the revelry, will then be exceedingly aggressive and volatile for the days after, raging through the surrounding area to sate the thirst of their cruel god.</p>\n<ul

little runtsâ¦ they ambushed us on the trail before weâd even been made aware weâd entered their âkingâsâ territory.Â  They attacked from out of the bushes like a tidal wave of bodies crashing into our cart, all the while gibbering in their foul, snarl of a tongue.Â  We should have been prepared for them, I recall their weaponry was so poor one bugger was swinging half a broom handle with a small iron spike driven through; nonetheless, they overwhelmed us with their surprise attack and made off with a hefty share of the campâs rations for the next month.<br /><em>Captain Will Freidmont of the Upper Wilds Valdyrguard.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Goblins are evil creatures of diminutive stature who exist in almost every corner of the natural world as a constant yet generally manageable threat.Â  Hailing from a group of creatures called goblinoids (which includes bugbears and hobgoblins), the goblin is a foul humanoid measuring no larger than the average halfling.Â  Goblins have skin tones varying from light clay to deep chestnut brown to a sickly, acidic green, their hair is thin and greasy, and within their jaws rest cracked and sharpened teeth.Â  Together with their foaming fellows, goblins form loose collectives or tribes so their power can stand pronounced in numbers.Â  The tribal life also allows for a crude caste system to erupt from the goblinâs chaotic politics.Â  All goblins have something to offer to the tribe, be they foragers, slavers, or warriors.Â  If they cannot contribute, they die.</p>\n<p><strong>We Live in a Society.Â </strong> Capricious to the last, goblins crave nothing more than power and domination of all others around them by any means (including those methods dangerous to the goblin).Â  Those goblins who possess enough might or cleverness may ascend to the rank of Goblin Boss and command a lair consisting of several dozens goblinoid fellows.Â  Should ambition prove overwhelming, the boss in rare cases may subjugate nearby lairs of rival goblinoids and crown themselves a Goblin Queen/King.Â  It has been documented that in one particular case, Queen Greld the Gutripper was able to enslave a camp containing hundreds of orcs, then laid siege to the city of Westerholt close by and sacked the entire city.</p>\n<p><strong>Gnash and Bite, Trick and Trap.</strong> Goblins maintain some of the most chaotic lairs within the known world, and to accomplish this the goblins require a plethora of slaves.Â  Not always willing to murder those they plunder, goblins and their kin are known slavers, spiriting away captured humans from merchant wagons to contruct their insidious dungeons.Â  WIthin a goblin lair is all manner of trap: tunnels leading nowhere, narrow passages no human could pass through, arrow slits, pits lined with spikes, and of course a multitude of alarms to warn the tribe of any impending danger.Â  Goblins utilize chaotic placement within their lairs to throw off intruders from their hard earned loot which is kept safe within the lairâs heart.</p>\n<p><strong>And They Dance About the Flames.</strong> Goblins, though commonly thought of as greedy and stupid, leave their chaotic tendancies behind when it comes to the structure of religious worship.Â  They are beholden in particular to The God of the Goblins, also called They Who Lurk Beneath, who acts as chief of all other gods to the goblinoids.Â  This god encourages acts of violence, blind cruelty, enslaving others, as well as war amongst the enemies of the goblins.Â  Goblin tribes will join together in times of worship to dance, perform rituals with blood and bone, build massive bonfires, and sew chaos throughout the lair all in devotion to their evil benefactor.Â  Goblins, fueled by the spirit of the revelry, will then be exceedingly aggressive and volatile for the days after, raging through the surrounding area to sate the thirst of their cruel god.</p>\n<ul

They are dedicated caretakers to their groves. If they even vaguely believe that some creature poses a threat to their trees, they will attack and kill it just to be sure that no potential threat has the chance to cause damage.
